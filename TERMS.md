Although a very small window of time (about one second), the trade escrow could be permanently lost if the coordinator were shutdown or suddenly disappeared between the seller confirming fiat was received and the moment the buyerâ€™s Lightning wallet registers the released escrow funds. Use a well-connected Lightning wallet with sufficient inbound liquidity to help avoid routing failures and subsequently minimize any such window of opportunity.
